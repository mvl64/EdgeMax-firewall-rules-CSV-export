This python script parses the "human readable" format of the Edgerouter configuration,
file "/config/congif.boot" and outputs a CSV file listing all the firewall rules in the format:

"[rulesetname]-[interface]-[action], [rulesetname]-[interface]-[description]"

For example:
GUEST_IN-10-D,GUEST_IN-Drop invalid state

This allows easy reporting in Splunk, using firewall rule names and descriptions, rather than cryptic codes (the first part of the line, before the comma)

NOTE: the script will first read the "previous version" of the firewall rules,
and apply modifications to it, based on current config.
This ensures old rules - deleted from the current configuration - can still be used in historical reports in Splunk
